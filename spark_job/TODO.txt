EPA DATA TODO LIST:
-------------------
[X] copy files from experiment_04 into a local directory for re-use as a new
    spark job
[X] remove unneeded data in HDFS
[X] inspect all scripts to have them use the new data sets
    Specifically check:
        [X] point.py
        [X] partition.py
        [X] experiment_04.py
[X] configure the spark driver to learn based on specified parameters
[X] rename experiment_04 script to a more appropriate name

Note:
-----
Remember to change the following for learning mean vs. max:
    * Point class definition
    * names of output files in epa_data_job.py
    * name of job in submit.sh
