EPA DATA TODO LIST:
-------------------
[X] copy files from experiment_04 into a local directory for re-use as a new
    spark job
[X] remove unneeded data in HDFS
[ ] inspect all scripts to have them use the new data sets
    Specifically check:
        [X] point.py
        [X] partition.py
        [ ] experiment_04.py
[ ] configure the spark driver to learn based on specified parameters
[ ] rename experiment_04 script to a more appropriate name
